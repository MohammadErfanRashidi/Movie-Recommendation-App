# Movie Recommendation System ðŸŽ¥

This is a Streamlit web application that recommends movies based on a user's favorite movie. It uses a **content-based filtering approach** by analyzing genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and director information from a movie dataset.

---

## Features
- Input your favorite movie and get a list of similar movies.
- Dynamic recommendations using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
- Easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit.

---

## How It Works
1. **Dataset**: The app uses a CSV file containing movie details such as genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director.
2. **Preprocessing**: Combines selected features into a single text column and converts it into numerical feature vectors using the **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Calculates cosine similarity between movies based on the feature vectors.
4. **Recommendation**: Identifies and lists movies similar to the one input by the user.
